For HardenedBSD repo... 

master branch based on HardenedBSD repo master branch. Do not modify.

mycurrent branch based on master branch. Push changes here.

plasma5-import branch based on master branch plus freebsd-ports-kde plasma5-import branch. There will probably be plenty of merge
conflicts to resolve before this branch can begin testing. Or really more prudent to wait until it is pushed into FreeBSD's main 
tree.
