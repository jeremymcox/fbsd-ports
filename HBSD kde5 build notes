For HardenedBSD repo... 

master branch based on HardenedBSD repo master branch. Do not modify.

mycurrent branch based on master branch. Push changes here.

plasma5-import branch based on master branch plus freebsd-ports-kde plasma5-import branch. There will probably be plenty of merge
conflicts to resolve before this branch can begin testing. Or really more prudent to wait until it is pushed into FreeBSD's main 
tree. 

BTW... net/boinc-client does build on HardenedBSD, but it requires OPENSSL in the base system, or boinc-client needs to be patched to work
with LibreSSL. Either way, for now it compiles with OPENSSL in the base. However, astro/boinc-setiathome does compile successfully on 
HardenedBSD, but workunits error out with undefined symbol: attach_shmem from libboinc-api.so. 


The merge of kde5-import branch into my import branch was shockingly easy thanks to the hard work of the KDE@ team integrating many of the
ports into FreeBSD's ports tree. Now comes the hard part: determining what ports build, what won't build and what hardening features are 
needed and/or work for each port. 

I can now see I need to use poudriere for this, to help disect the build failures. I already had a build failure on 
x11/kf5-plasma-framework. I need to determine if it was because it may require special patches to get it to work on HardenedBSD or if there
are some misapplied hardening features on its port or a port it depends on to build.
